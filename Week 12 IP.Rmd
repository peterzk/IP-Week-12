## 1. Introduction

* The goal of this analysis is to conduct explanatory data analysis to reveals patterns in the data.

* The metric for success is getting meaning information that allows us to understand the variables in our dataset.

### 1.1 Context

A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. She would now like to employ your services as a Data Science Consultant to help her identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads. 

## 2. Reading & Previewing Data


```{r Loading dataframe}

# First we we need to import the dataset

advert_data <- read.csv("advertising.csv")

# Previewing the top of out data

head(advert_data)

# Previewing the bottom of out data

tail(advert_data)

```

## 3. Checking Our Data

```{r Checking elements of dataframe}


# Checking the class of the object "advert_data"

class(advert_data)

# Our object is a data frame

# Checking the dimension of our dataset

dim(advert_data)

# Our dataset has 1000 rows and 10 columns

# Checking the structure of our data frame

str(advert_data)

# Our data frame has integer, number and character values

```


```{r Checking column names}
# Getting the names of the columns we will be working with

colnames(advert_data)

# "Daily.Time.Spent.on.Site" , "Age", "Area.Income", "Daily.Internet.Usage", "Ad.Topic.Line"
# "City", "Male", "Country", "Timestamp", "Clicked.on.Ad" 

```


## 4. Cleaning Data

```{r Checking for duplicates}

# Checking for duplicated values in our data set

anyDuplicated(advert_data)


# Since there are no duplicated values, no action is required

```


```{r Checking missing values}

# Checking if our dataset has any missing values

sum(is.na(advert_data))

# There are no null values in the dataset so no action is required


```


```{r Extracting the numeric variables}
# Checking for outliers in our dataset

# To check for outliers, we only need the numerical columns
# Getting numeric columns from the advert_data
nums <- unlist(lapply(advert_data, is.numeric)) 

numerical_cols <- advert_data[ ,nums]

head(numerical_cols)

# We can see that we have 6 numeric columns
#

# Plotting the boxplot to visualize the outliers in the dataset

boxplot(numerical_cols[,-1], horizontal=TRUE, main="Advertising Data")

# Only the Area income column has some outliers of people earning below 20,000

```

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis
